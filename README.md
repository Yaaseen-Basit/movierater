This Django project is a movie rating system where users can rate movies on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. The Movie model stores movie details, while the Rating model links users to their movie ratings. It ensures that each user can only rate a movie once and provides methods to calculate the average rating and total number of ratings for each movie.
